dark_cal_att_gen project includes:
	attitude.pl: a perl CGI script designed to be run from 
		the ASPECT web page
	table_17.csv: a table of Zodiacal Brightness values based
		on table 17 of Leinert et al. (1998), A&AS, 127, 1.
		This table is used by attitude.pl
	dark_attitudes.dat: list of potential dark current calibration
		attitudes based on number of stars; a subset of this
		list is selected based on zodiacal light constraints
		using attitude.pl 

The attitude.pl script returns an empty form if no parameters have been
submitted.  Part of the installation process is to actually use this to 
make a separate html file that is then used as the index.html for the 
project.  Thus, it makes good sense to edit the HTML generation code of 
attitude.pl to modify the form page that will eventually become 
index.html.
