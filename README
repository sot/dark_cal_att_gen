dark_cal_att_gen project includes:

	Makefile
	README: this text

	attitude.pl: a perl CGI script originally designed to be run
		the ASPECT web page, but now used to just filter a text file
	table_17.csv: a table of Zodiacal Brightness values based
		on table 17 of Leinert et al. (1998), A&AS, 127, 1.
		This table is used by attitude.pl
	full_dark_attitudes.dat: list of potential dark current calibration
		attitudes based on number of stars; a subset of this
		list is selected based on zodiacal light constraints
		using attitude.pl
	index.html: an html page with text indicating that the CGI is deprecated
        filter_atts_for_fot.py: Python script to filter the full_dark_attitudes.dat
                file and return the list of attitudes that would have appropriate
                zodiacal brightness if a calibration were run at a specified date
                (default is two weeks from now).
